# Magento 2 Cron Monitor

A Go CLI application that continuously monitors Magento 2 cron jobs by querying the `cron_schedule` database table to detect stuck or problematic cron jobs and logs alerts to a file.

## Features

- üîç **Continuous Monitoring** - Periodically checks cron status at configurable intervals
- üìä **Smart Detection** - Uses multiple criteria to identify stuck cron jobs:
  - Long-running jobs
  - Accumulating pending jobs
  - Consecutive errors
  - Missed executions
  - Threshold-based detection
- üö¶ **Scheduler Health** - Detects if the Magento cron scheduler process (`php bin/magento cron:run`) has stopped
- ÔøΩ **Slack Notifications** - Optional webhook integration for real-time alerts:
  - Stuck cron job notifications with detailed metrics
  - Recovery notifications when jobs resume normal operation
  - Configurable cooldown periods to prevent spam
  - Support for multiple webhook URLs
- üìù **Structured Logging** - JSON or text format logging to file and stdout
- üéØ **Selective Monitoring** - Configure different thresholds for different cron job_codes

## Configuration

Create a `config.yaml` file with your database connection details and monitoring preferences:

```yaml
database:
  host: "localhost"
  port: 3306
  name: "magento"
  user: "magento_user"
  password: "your_password"  # Supports ${ENV_VAR} syntax
  
monitor:
  # How often to check cron status
  interval: 2m
  
  detection:
    # Consecutive checks before flagging as stuck
    threshold_checks: 2
    # Maximum time a job should run
    max_running_time: 30m
    # Maximum pending jobs before alerting
    max_pending_count: 20
    # Consecutive errors before alerting
    consecutive_errors: 3
    # Maximum missed executions
    max_missed_count: 5
    # How far back to look in cron_schedule table
    lookback_window: 1h
    
    # Scheduler health detection
    scheduler_inactivity_minutes: 10
    scheduler_lookahead_minutes: 15

  # Optional: per-job overrides
  job_overrides:
    - job_code: "indexer_reindex_all_invalid"
      max_running_time: 180m
      threshold_checks: 3

logging:
  file: "./logs/magento-cron-monitor.log"
  level: "info"  # debug, info, warn, error
  format: "json"  # json or text

notifications:
  slack:
    enabled: false  # Set to true to enable Slack notifications
    webhook_urls:
      - "https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL"
    alert_cooldown: 15m
    send_recovery: true
    recovery_cooldown: 5m
    timeout: 10s
```

### Configuration Options

#### Database Settings

- `host` - MySQL/MariaDB server hostname
- `port` - Database port (default: 3306)
- `name` - Database name
- `user` - Database username
- `password` - Database password (supports `${ENV_VAR}` syntax)

#### Monitor Settings

- `interval` - How often to check cron jobs (e.g., `60s`, `2m`, `5m`)
- `detection.threshold_checks` - Consecutive checks before alerting (reduces false positives)
- `detection.max_running_time` - Alert if job runs longer than this
- `detection.max_pending_count` - Alert if more pending jobs than this threshold
- `detection.consecutive_errors` - Alert after this many consecutive errors
- `detection.max_missed_count` - Alert if job missed this many times in lookback window
- `detection.lookback_window` - Time range to query from `cron_schedule` table
- `detection.scheduler_inactivity_minutes` - Alert if no jobs created in this timeframe (default: 10)
- `detection.scheduler_lookahead_minutes` - AND no pending jobs scheduled in next X minutes (default: 15)
- `job_overrides` - Per-job overrides for specific job codes

#### Configuration Priority

The monitor applies thresholds in the following priority order (highest to lowest):

1. **Job-specific overrides** (`job_overrides`) - Exact job_code match
3. **Global defaults** (`detection`) - Base configuration

Example: If `indexer_reindex_all_invalid` has a job override with `max_running_time: 180m`, it will use that instead of the the global default `30m`.

#### Logging Settings

- `file` - Path to log file (directory will be created if needed)
- `level` - Log level: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`
- `format` - Log format: `json` or `text`

#### Notification Settings

- `slack.enabled` - Enable/disable Slack notifications
- `slack.webhook_urls` - Array of Slack incoming webhook URLs (notifications sent to all)
- `slack.alert_cooldown` - Minimum time between stuck alerts for same cron job (e.g., `15m`)
- `slack.send_recovery` - Send notifications when stuck cron jobs recover
- `slack.recovery_cooldown` - Minimum time between recovery notifications (e.g., `5m`)
- `slack.timeout` - HTTP timeout for webhook requests

## Usage

```bash
# Use default config.yaml in current directory
./go-magento-cron-monitor monitor

# Use custom config file
./go-magento-cron-monitor monitor --config /path/to/config.yaml
```

## Detection Criteria

### Stuck Cron Jobs

The monitor checks for several types of problems with individual cron jobs:

1. **Long-Running Jobs** - Jobs that have been in `running` status longer than `max_running_time`
2. **Pending Accumulation** - More than `max_pending_count` jobs with `pending` status for the same job code
3. **Consecutive Errors** - Job has failed `consecutive_errors` times in a row
4. **Missed Executions** - Job has `missed` status more than `max_missed_count` times within `lookback_window`

All detections use threshold-based alerting: the condition must be detected `threshold_checks` consecutive times before an alert is logged. This reduces false positives from transient issues.

### Scheduler Health (STUCK CRON SCHEDULER)

In addition to monitoring individual cron jobs, the monitor also checks if the Magento cron scheduler process itself (`php bin/magento cron:run`) is running. This is critical because if the scheduler stops, jobs won't be created or executed even though they may appear "healthy" in the database.

The scheduler is considered stuck when **BOTH** conditions are true:
1. No new jobs have been created in the last `scheduler_inactivity_minutes` (default: 10 minutes)
2. No pending jobs are scheduled for the next `scheduler_lookahead_minutes` (default: 15 minutes)

This dual-check approach prevents false positives during normal periods of low cron activity. The alert will be logged as:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-22T09:59:00Z",
  "level": "ERROR",
  "message": "STUCK CRON SCHEDULER",
  "job_code": "SCHEDULER",
  "reason": "No jobs created in 10 minutes and no pending jobs scheduled for next 15 minutes"
}
```

### Slack Integration

To set up Slack notifications:

1. Create a Slack incoming webhook:
   - Go to your Slack workspace settings
   - Navigate to **Apps** ‚Üí **Incoming Webhooks**
   - Click **Add to Slack** and select a channel
   - Copy the webhook URL

2. Add the webhook URL(s) to your `config.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   notifications:
     slack:
       enabled: true
       webhook_urls:
         - "https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL"
   ```

3. Customize notification settings:
   - Adjust `alert_cooldown` to prevent spam (default: 15 minutes)
   - Enable/disable `send_recovery` for recovery notifications
   - Add multiple webhook URLs to send to different channels

**Notification Types:**
- **Stuck Cron Job Alert** üö® - Sent when a cron job becomes stuck, includes detailed metrics (job code, status, last execution, reason)
- **Cron Job Recovered** ‚úÖ - Sent when a stuck cron job resumes normal operation, includes recovery duration
